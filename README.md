# Time_Series_Introduction
This repo contains Time Series introduction notes and python code as taught by [Srivatsan Srinivasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srivatsan-srinivasan-b8131b/) on his [AIEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBs8TLOogwyGd0GxHCp-Dw) youtube channel. I have added shortcuts or alternative ways of analysis whenever possible. If you are planning on using the notebooks, they are classified in a manner as follows:
1. Key basic concepts of Time Series
2. Simple data exploration and analysis techniques with pandas and plotting modules
3. Handling missing values in Time Series
4. Exploring various moving average concepts and analytic techniques
