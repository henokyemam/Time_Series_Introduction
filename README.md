# Time_Series_Introduction
This repo contains Time Series introduction notes and python code as taught by [Srivatsan Srinivasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srivatsan-srinivasan-b8131b/) on his [AIEngineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBs8TLOogwyGd0GxHCp-Dw) youtube channel. I have added shortcuts or alternative ways of analysis whenever possible. If you are planning on using the notebooks, they are classified in a manner as follows:
1. Key basic concepts of Time Series
2. Simple data exploration and analysis techniques with pandas and plotting modules
3. Handling missing values in Time Series
    * Data used to demonstrate 2 and 3:

4. Exploring various Moving Average analytic techniques and interpretations.

5. Exploring Time Series Decomposition to trend, seasonality, residual
6. Exploring python modeling techniques and analysis
